For example, if you are trying to debug incorrect rules, it would be useful to have a trace of rewrites showing how an example given bad equivalence was found. `egg` uses an algorithm adapted from Proof-Producing Congruence Closure in order to generate such `Explanation`s between two given terms."]]});
